    <p>01 - Salty cookie base dough.</p>
    <p>Ingredients: 
        <br> 
        <ul>
            <li>all purpose flour: 200g</li>
            <li>butter: 150g</li>
            <li>salt: to taste, but at least half a teaspoon</li>
            <li>ice cold water: 30g</li>
            <li>Addins as per specified by the recipe that refers here for the base dough</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        For lactose intolerant people: you can replace butter 1:1 with any sort of solid fat except coconut fat.
        <br> <br>
        add all the ingredients except for the addins to the bowl, cut up the butter beforehand <br>
        and work it into a doughball. the ball of dough should be relatively soft and pliable,<br>
        but hold its shape and not smear. add the addins and work it into a uniform dough ball. <br>
        refrigerate for one hour. make into cookies and bake for 7 minutes at 200c. 
        <br> <br>
        baking time is not absolute, it may take faster or slower for you, <br>
        but the cookies should be very slightly darker at the edges to know <br>
        when they are done visually. 
        <br> <br>
        the dough makes for airy cookies, some may form bubbles in it. <br>
        the cookies do not spread while baking, they will shrink slightly when cooling.

    <br> <br> <br>
    <p>02 - Sweet cookie dough</p>
    <p>this dough has multiple uses:</p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hard Tart base</li>
            <li>Sweet pie crust</li>
            <li>Cookies</li>
            <li>Gingerbreads</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Ingredients: 
        <br> 
        <ul>
            <li>all purpose flour: 400g</li>
            <li>butter: 200g</li>
            <li>sugar: 200g</li>
            <li>egg: one</li>
            <li>Addins as per specified by the recipe that refers here for the base dough</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        For lactose intolerant people: you can replace butter 1:1 with any sort of solid fat except coconut fat.
        <br>
        For diverging dough usage, the sugar can be replaced 1:1 with any sort of other sugar product or natura sugar substitute.
        <br>
        These being: sugar, molasses, brown sugar, caster sugar, honey, fructose. 
        <br>
        The sugars can also be mixed and matched, in both: type and state. you can mix solid sugars with liquid ones.
        <br> <br>
        Into a large bowl, add the flour and sugar. make a well in the center for the egg and <br>
        cut up the butter, after which you put butter pieces around the egg. Mix and form the dough<br>
        into a ball. the dough should be stiff and not too pliable. the bowl should also come clean <br>
        after it has fully formed. After that, refrigerate the dough for atleast half an hour. <br>
        There is no maximum refrigeration time, as this dough can be frozen in the ice box for <br>
        later usage. I dont recommend to freeze it for over a week. for immediate use, do not <br>
        refrigerate in the ice box, just normal fridge area. After refrigeration, please refer <br>
        to the forming instructions in the recipe which refers to this recipe. <br>
        <br> <br>
        baking time is not absolute, it may take faster or slower for you, <br>
        but the cookies should be very slightly darker at the edges to know <br>
        when they are done visually. 
        <br> <br>
        the dough makes for medium-dense cookies, bubbles dont normally appear with proper dough <br>
        reforming. the cookies do not spread while baking, they dont shrink when cooling.
