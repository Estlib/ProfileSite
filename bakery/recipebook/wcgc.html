    <p>Woven Chocolate Glaze Cookies</p>
    <br> <br>
    <p>Dough: 02 <a href="../../bakery/universalrecipes.html">Click here the base dough recipe.</a> 
        <p>Ingredients: 
            <br> 
            <ul>
                <li>all purpose flour: 400g</li>
                <li>butter: 200g</li>
                <li>sugar: 200g</li>
                <li>egg: one</li>
                <li>Vanilla: to taste, can be either sugar form or extract. any works</li>
                <li>Brown Glaze from xocofine. More on this below.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            For lactose intolerant people: you can replace butter 1:1 with any sort of solid fat except coconut fat.
            <br>
            For diverging dough usage, the sugar can be replaced 1:1 with any sort of other sugar product or natura sugar substitute.
            <br>
            These being: sugar, molasses, brown sugar, caster sugar, honey, fructose. 
            <br>
            The sugars can also be mixed and matched, in both: type and state. you can mix solid sugars with liquid ones.
            <br>
            For the glaze, while the recipe specifies a specific product, if you are proficient in chocolate or couverture tempering
            <br>
            i recommend you go for that instead. I am using this because its foolproof. no tempering needed and it hardens pretty fast.
            <br> <br>
            Into a large bowl, add the flour and sugar. make a well in the center for the egg and <br>
            cut up the butter, after which you put butter pieces around the egg. Mix and form the dough<br>
            into a ball. the dough should be stiff and not too pliable. the bowl should also come clean <br>
            after it has fully formed. After that, refrigerate the dough for atleast half an hour. <br>
            There is no maximum refrigeration time, as this dough can be frozen in the ice box for <br>
            later usage. I dont recommend to freeze it for over a week. for immediate use, do not <br>
            refrigerate in the ice box, just normal fridge area. After refrigeration, roll out the dough <br>
            on a table, the thickness of the dough is up to you, based on what you can handle. You can <br>
            go thinner for better veawing control or thicker for a thicker cookie. I recommend going <br>
            thicker, as thin ones burn really easy. After rolling out the dough, make the strips roughly <br>
            5mm wide, and between 8-12 cm in length, prepare 2 small parchment pieces, on one of them,<br>
            put some flour on it and weave 5 strips horisontally and 5 vertically, this size should be<br>
            big enough for a large circle cutter. dont forget to press lightly on the "joints" for <br>
            a proper adherance, it is important when transferring the circle onto the baking tray. <br>
            after your weaving is complete, cut the circle out, but dont remove the cutter after pressing <br>
            the cookie out, before you lift it away, remove the residual dough around it. Then lift the <br>
            cookie cutter. This ensures that the shape is preserved before lifting, as removing the <br>
            excess afterwards can warp and distort the brittle shape. this is a finicky cookie to make. <br>
            Transferring happens with the help of the other small parchment piece. make sure that the <br>
            other parchment piece is floured too, place the other piece ontop of the one your weaving is on <br>
            hold it in your hand and flip it over. The cookie should flip onto the other piece relatively easy <br>
            if it doesnt, some peeling may be required. If it does happen that you need to peel it, peel it <br>
            gently with the edge of a knife, and flour the parchment paper well afterwards. once the cookie <br>
            is on the other parchment, move it over the baking tray, place it onto the tray and either: <br>
            slide it off gently with minimal finger involvement or yank the parchment piece out from it <br>
            in one fast motion. see which one works better for you, but in either case, if you need to <br>
            reposition the cookie on the tray a bit, then you need to move it with two fingers, taking <br>
            hold of the cookie from the centermost "joint" and moving it gently that way. <br>
            Congratulations - your cookie is now on the tray. Bake it for 5-7 minutes at 200c<br>
            after you have all of your cookies baked, it is time to partially enrobe them in <br>
            glaze. if you have your own method for this, feel free to diverge from these instructions <br>
            but for the rest of you, melt the xocofine glaze on a waterbath type of setup. im just using <br>
            my kettle and a bowl directly on the stove to do this, so you dont need special equiptment <br>
            either. not an electric kettle mind you, the old fashioned type of water kettle. <br>
            the glaze will not run on its own, you need to spoon it on if you have a shallow setup <br>
            and you also might need something to empty the holes manually, as sometimes the glaze <br>
            is thick enough to close those too. place the freshly glazed cookie on some parchment paper <br>
            or other nonstick surface to cool and harden. once the hardening is complete, you have your <br>
            glorious woven cookies. one dough took me an entire day to do. its the weaving that takes<br>
            most of the time to do <br>

            <br> <br>
            baking time is not absolute, it may take faster or slower for you, but for this recipe, <br>
            i reccommend you premake all the trayfuls because this cookie bakes FAST. 5 minutes is on <br>
            the high side once your oven gets going at 200c. but as per usual, they are done when the cookies <br>
            are very slightly darker at the edges. they also need to cool on the tray, as these WILL <br>
            crumble if moved when warm and not set. The reason they bake fast is that due to the holes <br>
            in the weaving, it has more surface area enabling a fast baking time. <br>
            <br> <br>
            the dough makes for crunchy cookies, bubbles dont normally appear with proper dough <br>
            reforming. the cookies do not spread while baking, they dont shrink when cooling.
