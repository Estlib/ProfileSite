= Questions that might be in a FAQ, aswell as their answers.
--Why did you stop doing youtube?
----To be honest - it got real expensive without a real return. i mightve started it as a kid, but when i ended it
----i was no longer a kid and i needed to move on. i wouldve gladly continued to do so had i progressed to a state 
----where it could support me, but it was just impractical to continue to do so as it had been up to that point.
----Passion is good and all, but it doesnt pay, if what you make is something people dont like and ultimately dont
----want to watch. 
----Another reason i found myself in during the final years on youtube was the burnout and pressure to fit in with 
----other content creators. So my channel of "whatever i felt like doing" suffered - and it suffered alot. It is
----very hard to reconcile a split followerbase when some are here for paladins, others for original music, hummer
----team, snacktime and so on. Its hard to maintain that, but it was also a holdover from my original channel - in
----essence it was still me doing whatever i want, but with more traditional gaming content fit into that. Though
----even the way i did it isnt actually too conventional. so, not sure.
----The third reason i have is that i just want to do other things now. Old hobbies arent really doing it for me 
----anymore, so i want more time - and more importantly: the release of pressure i feel from doing youtube - to do
----other things.
--Why are there things here that ive never seen on your youtube?
----Because i can.
--Why did you make this site after youre done with youtube?
----To consolidate and conserve my time on youtube, it hasnt been for nothing despite its unsustainability. I
----learned many things because of it and gave me an outlet and an aspiration towards gaming and computers.
--Are you ever coming back to youtube?
----If i ever return, it will never be as i left it and as such, there are two ways i see myself ever making a
----return - I either make a video about a thing i want to show, without a schedule on my current main channel
----or i split my hobbies into their own channel, uploading every once in a while, to help with algorithm.
----kind of like a streamer on twitch may have a channel for full VODs, shorts, highlights aswell as other content
----this would mean things like snacktime has its own channel, original music, TF2 maps, etc etc.
----however. A return of the latter sort is unlikely. If i ever were to, the first option is the most probable.
